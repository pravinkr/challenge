Please fallow the instructions carefully:
  
1. Run Install from the ide menu once before you start coding 
            (or)
   type the command "sudo sh .install.sh"

2. You can code the api in whatever language you wish but you have to install all the dependancies by yourself

3. Springboot and Python basic templates have been initialised for you if you choose to proceed with them

4. The apis should return the exact responses described in the question

5. Keep your api server running when you submit the test 

Thank you and happy coding....
